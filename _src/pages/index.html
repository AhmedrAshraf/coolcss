  <h2>The last CSS framework I'll (hopefully) ever have to build.</h2>

  <p>Between switching jobs and starting a bunch of side-projects, I've found myself re-writing a lot of CSS in the past year. Wouldn't it be nice, I thought, if I could just write one CSS framework and use it on any project? <strong>Cool.css</strong> is my attempt to do just that.</p>
