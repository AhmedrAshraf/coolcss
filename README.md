# cool.css

## The last CSS framework I'll (hopefully) ever have to make

Between switching jobs and starting a bunch of side-projects, I've found myself re-writing a lot of CSS in the past year. Wouldn't it be nice, I thought, if I could just write one CSS framework and use it on any project? **Cool.css** is my attempt to do just that.

### Just what the world needs&mdash;another fucking CSS framework!

Yes, I know. I feel the same way. [Check out the website](https://coolcss.dev) to read more about **cool.css** and why it might be worth trying out.

## How to Use ##

**Note:** This is a work-in-progress, so it's not quite ready for people to use yet, but you're more than welcome to try it out and kick the tires.

**cool.css** is built on Eleventy.

1. Fork the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start Eleventy
4. Open `https://localhost:8080` in a browser
5. Edit `_src/sass/_tokens/_tokens.scss` to your heart's content

You should be able to achieve whatever look your going for just by updating the tokens. The idea is that you should never have to touch the CSS unless you're adding new components or layouts.
