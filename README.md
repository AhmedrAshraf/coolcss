# cool.css

## The last CSS framework I'll (hopefully) ever have to make

Between switching jobs and starting a bunch of side-projects, I've found myself re-writing a lot of CSS in the past year. Wouldn't it be nice, I thought, if I could just write one CSS framework and use it on any project? **Cool.css** is my attempt to do just that.

### Just what the world needs&mdash;another fucking CSS framework!

Yes, I know. I feel the same way.
